# Gale-Shapley-Algorithim
Program that generates two sets of preferences lists and implements the gale shapley algorithim to find a stable match set using hashmaps and treemaps

Using the Generator.java and the males.txt/females.txt files user enters a number of the amount of names they want to use to generate a preference list which is written into setA and setB

Using setA and setB in the Launcher.java program will find a stable match set for each male/female in setA and setB then check to see if each match is stable.
